## Authentication Flow

1. User logs in via `/login` page using Supabase Auth
2. Middleware checks authentication status
3. User role is fetched from database using `authId`
4. User is redirected to appropriate dashboard based on role:
   - `/admin` for ADMIN
   - `/teacher` for TEACHER
   - `/student` for STUDENT
   - `/parent` for PARENT

## Role-Based Access Control

### Middleware Protection
- Protected routes: `/admin`, `/teacher`, `/student`, `/parent`
- Users can only access their role-specific dashboard
- Role is fetched from database, not metadata
- Each dashboard page verifies its own role for additional security

### Dashboard Layout
- Shared sidebar with navigation
- User profile display with avatar
- Sign out functionality
- Mobile-responsive header

## API Routes

### Students API
- `GET /api/students` - List all students (with class info)
- `POST /api/students` - Create new student
- `GET /api/students/[id]` - Get single student (with submissions, attendance, exams)
- `PUT /api/students/[id]` - Update student
- `DELETE /api/students/[id]` - Delete student

### Teachers API
- `GET /api/teachers` - List all teachers (with assigned subjects)
- `POST /api/teachers` - Create new teacher
- `GET /api/teachers/[id]` - Get single teacher
- `PUT /api/teachers/[id]` - Update teacher
- `DELETE /api/teachers/[id]` - Delete teacher

### Classes API
- `GET /api/classes` - List all classes (with students and subjects)
- `POST /api/classes` - Create new class

### Subjects API
- `GET /api/subjects` - List all subjects
- `POST /api/subjects` - Create new subject

### Class-Subjects API

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database
- Supabase project

### Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` in the `lms` directory:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"
```

### Installation

1. Navigate to LMS directory:
```bash
cd lms
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up database:
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

4. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open http://localhost:3000

## User Management

### Creating Users
All users are managed through Supabase Authentication. The workflow:

1. **Create user in Supabase Dashboard**: Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Users and create users with their email and password
2. **Create database profile**: After creating a user in Supabase, use the seed script to create the corresponding database profile

### Creating Admin Profile
1. Create a user in Supabase Dashboard with admin credentials
2. Copy the user ID from Supabase Dashboard
3. Update `prisma/seed.js` with the user ID, email, and name
4. Run the seed script:
```bash
npm run seed
```

### Creating Other User Profiles
For teachers, students, and parents, you can either:
- Use the API routes to create profiles after Supabase user creation
- Manually insert records in the database
- Create a custom seed script for bulk user creation

## Common Tasks

### Add New Class
1. Create class via API: `POST /api/classes`
2. Create subjects via API: `POST /api/subjects`
3. Assign teachers: `POST /api/class-subjects`

### Add New Student
1. Create user in Supabase Auth
2. Create student via API: `POST /api/students`
3. Link to parent (if needed): Create `ParentStudent` record

### Assign Teacher to Subject
1. Ensure teacher and class-subject exist
2. Use API: `POST /api/class-subjects` with `classId`, `subjectId`, `teacherId`

## Troubleshooting

### Middleware Issues
If users are redirected incorrectly:
- Check database role matches Supabase auth ID
- Verify `authId` is correctly set in User table
- Check middleware logs for errors

### Database Connection
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`
- Run `npx prisma db push` to sync schema
- Check PostgreSQL is running

### Authentication Issues
- Verify Supabase credentials in `.env.local`
- Check user exists in Supabase Auth
- Ensure User record exists in database with correct `authId`

## Future Enhancements

### UI Improvements
- Implement modal dialogs for CRUD operations
- Add loading states and error handling
- Create dedicated pages for each entity (students list, teachers list, etc.)
- Add file upload functionality for materials and assignments

### Functionality
- Implement attendance marking interface
- Create assignment grading interface
- Add exam creation and result entry
- Implement parent-child linking interface
- Add notification system
- Create reporting/analytics features

### Security
- Add rate limiting to API routes
- Implement proper role checks in API routes
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Implement CSRF protection

## Development Notes

### Database Schema Changes
When modifying `schema.prisma`:
1. Make changes to schema
2. Run `npx prisma generate`
3. Run `npx prisma db push` (development) or create migration (production)

### Adding New API Routes
1. Create route file in `app/api/[resource]/route.js`
2. Implement GET, POST, PUT, DELETE as needed
3. Add authentication check using Supabase
4. Add role-based authorization if needed
5. Include error handling and validation

### Dashboard Updates
When updating dashboards:
1. Fetch real data from database using Prisma
2. Handle empty states gracefully
3. Add loading states for better UX
4. Maintain consistent styling with existing theme
